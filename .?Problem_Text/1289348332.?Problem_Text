==Swallowed html in nowiki tags==

The break tag in here is not rendered as literal text despite being in nowiki and code tags. This differs from mediawiki's behavior.

"To create a line break put this <code><nowiki><br/ ></nowiki></code> in your markup."

==Recursive templates==
Templates don't ignore things inside the &lt;noinclude&gt; tags, and so you get a stack-level too deep crash in cases where a template documents itself.
