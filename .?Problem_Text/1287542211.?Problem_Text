[[test output]] is segfaulting -- not happening on OSX.  Will have to check on Linux.

[[WikiPagesDontWorkYet]] also segfaults -- also safe on OSX. Linux is pickier and a better place to find these.

[[Lists]] Copied from mediawiki examples are a little fugly.  Possibly the inline colon throws them off.
