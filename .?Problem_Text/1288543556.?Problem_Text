==Links around Images==

Images should link to absolute paths like '/File:Picture.jpg' instead of relative links (i.e. 'File:Picture.jpg').

The later confuses my browser and causes it to link to file:///Picture.jpg, which won't work at all.

==Unescaped html in nowiki tags==

The break tag in here is rendered.

<code><nowiki><br /></nowiki></code>
