Since you're reinventing wiki over here, one cool feature you might add is the ability to double-click to edit. FlexWiki has this but I haven't seen any others do it. It is *surprisingly* engaging.

Hmm... guess I should have CamelCased this?

Humm... and ?what about "single-click to edit" at http://simpliwiki.com. And (in some not so distant future, thanks to http://codemirror.net/ maybe) what about "0 click to edit" => no more "edit mode", page is directly editable. See also etherpad.org)  -- JeanHuguesRobert aka @jhr
