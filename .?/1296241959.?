==Welcome to the Kiwi Wiki==

[[YAPWTP]] (now [YAPWTP Kiwi]) is a MediaWiki text parser currently under heavy development.  It is written in [[Peg/Leg]] and [[C]] and aims to be a lightweight, extremely fast alternative to using [http://www.MediaWiki.org MediaWiki] and [[PHP]] for parsing MediaWiki text.  Currently it is capable of parsing a 100 line MediaWiki text file including images, tables, and lots of markup in about 5ms on a one year old [http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/ Apple laptop].

You can see the revision of [[YAPWTP]] this site is running at [[VERSION.txt]].  You can see the revision history at [http://github.com/thomasluce/YAPWTP/commits/master].

Here is a some recent [[test output]] which somewhat describes what it's capable of.  And here is a [[SandBox]] to play around in.  You can also [[a_cool_feature|Double Click To Edit]].

[http://yapwtp.drasticcode.com YAPWTP.drasticcode.com] is a wiki environment that uses [[YAPWTP]]. Its source code is available on [http://github.com/samg/wikiwiki github].

Its goal is to document the current state of [[YAPWTP]] development and demonstrate its current functionality.
