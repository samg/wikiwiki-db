==Welcome to the YAPWTP Wiki==

[[YAPWTP]] is a pre-alpha WikiText parser currently under heavy development.  It is written in [[Peg/Leg]] and aims to be a lightweight, extremely fast alternative to using [http://www.MediaWiki.org|MediaWiki] and PHP for parsing WikiText.

You can see the revision of YAPWTP this site is running (git sha) at [[VERSION.txt]]

Here is a some recent [[test output]] which somewhat describes what it's capable of.


[http://yamwtp.drasticcode.com] is an wiki environment that uses [[YAPWTP]]. Its source code is available on [http://github.com/samg/wikiwiki github].

Its goal is to document the current state of [[YAPWTP]] development and demonstrate its current functionality.
