'''C''' ({{pron-en|&#712;si&#720;}} {{respell|see}}) is a general-purpose computer [[programming language]] developed in 1972 by [[Dennis Ritchie]] at the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] for use with the [[Unix]] [[operating system]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Stewart | first = Bill | work = Living Internet | date =  January 7, 2000 |  url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_c.htm| title=History of the C Programming Language| accessdate=2006-10-31}}</ref>

Although C was designed for implementing [[system software]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.adaic.com/docs/reports/lawlis/k.htm | title = Guidelines for Choosing a Computer Language: Support for the Visionary Organization | year = 1997 | author = Patricia K.

C is one of the most popular programming languages of all time<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.langpop.com/ | title = Programming Language Popularity | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html | title = TIOBE Programming Community Index | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-06}}</ref> and there are very few [[computer architecture]]s for which a C [[compiler]] does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably [[C++]], which began as an extension to C.
